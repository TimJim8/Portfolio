# My first blog
The shop had a very productive start to the year. I finally orginized the Robotics Team shelf with Ibrahim. In adition to this I also cleared out my box and made a new label to replace the old one. After a few days of orginizing I started working with Jonas to set up the Tormach mills. So far we have refilled the oil, restarted the system, and cleaned the vices of rust.

I spent a large portion of the week performing reaserch for BOB ROV. I found these to be important aspects of the design:

Seamless Tube Manufacturing (Part Sourcing)
It is highly beneficial for the tube to be seamless (not welded together). This is because buckling often occurs at imperfections, dents, and seams. It is very difficult to account for these imperfections with an imperfect stock piece. To make up for this shortcoming the tubeâ€™s thickness would have to greatly exceed what it would otherwise necessitate with a seamless tube.

Weldability 
The ability to weld the tube without compromising its integrity drastically reduces possible points of failure in the sealing system. The only feasible alternative to a welded flange design is a split collar. Bolting the two part flange around the tube, using its compression to join primary components. Successfully connecting the flange this way without damaging the tube would require careful calculations and extra design considerations. A single overtightening could destroy the tube, necessitating excess time and cost for replacement. Therefore it is absolutely essential that the chosen material be weldable.

I also designed the external frame for BOB ROV. I decided to use 4 tubes running parallel to the central electronics tube. These tubes serve as handles, modular mounting points, and cable channels. Each tube is conected to the each flange with a custom split collar design. To increase friction for the split collar, and to improve grip the tubes will be knurled.
