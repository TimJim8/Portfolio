# My first blog
I spent a large portion of the week performing reaserch for BOB ROV. I found these to be important aspects of the design:

Seamless Tube Manufacturing (Part Sourcing)
It is highly beneficial for the tube to be seamless (not welded together). This is because buckling often occurs at imperfections, dents, and seams. It is very difficult to account for these imperfections with an imperfect stock piece. To make up for this shortcoming the tubeâ€™s thickness would have to greatly exceed what it would otherwise necessitate with a seamless tube.

Weldability 
The ability to weld the tube without compromising its integrity drastically reduces possible points of failure in the sealing system. The only feasible alternative to a welded flange design is a split collar. Bolting the two part flange around the tube, using its compression to join primary components. Successfully connecting the flange this way without damaging the tube would require careful calculations and extra design considerations. A single overtightening could destroy the tube, necessitating excess time and cost for replacement. Therefore it is absolutely essential that the chosen material be weldable. 

I compiled this list of possible material choices.
